      My name is Boen Wang and I am currently in high school. This is my personal website where you can learn all about my different school and other activities, as well as me personally. This site is honestly more for me, a valuable reference source when I need to apply to summer programs and whatnot in the future. With my willingness and determination to learn, it took me two weeks starting from scratch to create this website using HTML, CSS, as well as bits of JavaScipt here and there. It is my prized product and I take great pride in it. I will continuously update the website with new content as new things come up in life. Scroll down or click on a page and start touring!
