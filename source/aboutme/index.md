# About Me

### This Page will tell you all about me.

![Me at Great Wall](/img/greatwall.jpg)

I think of myself as a curious and motivated student, someone who takes action in their own learning. If I set my mind to something, I will always try to complete it. I can be really competitive at times in sports and studies. If I see someone better than me, I strive to become better than them. Although school and studies are a big part of my life, I also enjoy greatly to play. I love to play videogames and watch videos, although I have to admit it does sometimes interfere with work as one video can lead to many more. I also really enjoy traveling and hanging out with friends. People have said I'm pretty social, for me, making friends is quite easy. With these hobbies is also my uncanny obsession with mechanical pencils and fountain pens. My family consists of my parents, an older brother and a younger sister, which can be a bit chaotic at times but full of fun times. 




## My Heritage

### Love for China

China is where my parents came from, and I continously keep close ties with the country. I go to China very often, probably about once every two years. Most of my relatives still reside in China, so I go back to visit them. China is a country rich in history and culture. I love visiting the many historical monuments such as the Great Wall of China. The culture is bursting with energy. I went back during Chinese New Year once and it was so chaotic full of firecracks, dumplings, red envelopes, these being only a few of the traditions. With these old dated traditions, China is also very modern. Beijing, where I usually go, has almost gone completely cashless. Everywhere accepts mobile pay and QR codes are everywhere. The public transportation is extremely convenient too. In my opinion however, it is the food that is the best. From peking duck to French onion soup, you can eat all the flavors of the world in one city.
