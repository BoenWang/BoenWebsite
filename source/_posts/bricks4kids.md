During the summer before 9th grade, I volunteered at a church run camp. The camp was about teaching lego building to kids while incorporating biblical lessons. My job included mainly helping kids, grades K-2nd, out with the lego builds as well as supervising them during breaks or lunch. I also helped supervise four year olds. I volunteered for two weeks for a total of about 70 hours.
