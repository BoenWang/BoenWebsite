During the summer before 10th grade, I went to China and worked at my uncle's company. I learned how to code and build websites, with this very website built during that time. I also studied and practiced some Java. It was mainly work on JavaServer Pages and making websites dynamic. The "study internship" lasted for five weeks and was about 30 hours per week.
